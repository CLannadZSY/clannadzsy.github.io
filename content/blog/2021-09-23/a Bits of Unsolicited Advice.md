  总是要求有一个最后期限, 一个最后期限可以剔除不相干和普通的东西. 它阻止你试图让它变得完美，所以你必须让它变得不同. 不同就是更好.

- Don’t be the best. Be the only.

  不要做最好的, 要做唯一的
  
  


- Promptness is a sign of respect.

  及时是尊重的表现
  
  
  
- The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it. Good habits can range from telling the truth, to flossing.

  养成习惯的目的是从自我协商中消除这种行为. 你不在花费精力来决定是否做这件事情. 你只是做了它. 好的习惯可以从诚实到使用牙线

  要做好事, 就去做. 要想做出伟大的东西, 只要重做, 重做, 重做. 创造美好的事物的秘诀在于不断重试
  
  
  
- To make mistakes is human. To own your mistakes is divine. Nothing elevates a person higher than quickly admitting and taking personal responsibility for the mistakes you make and then fixing them fairly. If you mess up, fess up. It’s astounding how powerful this ownership is.

  犯错误是人之常情. 拥有自己的错误是神圣的. 没有什么比迅速承认并且为你所犯的错误承担责任. 然后公平的纠正它们更能提升一个人的地位. 如果你搞砸了, 坦白承认吧, 这种所有权的力量是令人震惊的.
  
  
  
- Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgment.

  将创作和改进的过程分开. 你不能同时进行写作和编辑, 雕刻或抛光, 制作与分析. 如果你这样做, 编辑会妨碍你的创作. 当你发明时, 不要选择. 当你画草图时, 不要检查. 当你写第一稿时, 不要反思. 在开始时, 创作者的头脑必须从判断中解放出来.
  
  
  
- If you are not falling down occasionally, you are just coasting.

  如果你没有偶尔摔倒, 你就是在滑行

  也许宇宙中最反直觉的真理是, 你给别人的越多, 你得到的就越多. 明摆这一点是智慧的开始
  
  
  
- Be prepared: When you are 90% done any large project (a house, a film, an event, an app) the rest of the myriad details will take a second 90% to complete.

  做好准备. 当你完成任何大型项目(房子, 电影, 活动, 应用程序) 的 90% 的时候, 剩余无数的细节将需要第二个 90% 来完成
  
  
  
- Anything real begins with the fiction of what could be. Imagination is therefore the most potent force in the universe, and a skill you can get better at. It’s the one skill in life that benefits from ignoring what everyone else knows.

  任何真实的东西都始于对可能事情的虚构. 因此, 想象力是宇宙中最强大的力量, 也是一种你可以变得更好的技能. 它是生活中一种技能, 可以从其他人忽略的事情中收益
  
  
  
- When crisis and disaster strike, don’t waste them. No problems, no progress.

  当危机和灾难来临时, 不要浪费它们. 没有问题, 就没有进步
  
  
  
- Eliminating clutter makes room for your true treasures.

- A vacation + a disaster = an adventure.

- Following your bliss is a recipe for paralysis if you don’t know what you are passionate about. A better motto for most youth is “master something, anything”. Through mastery of one thing, you can drift towards extensions of that mastery that bring you more joy, and eventually discover where your bliss is.

  如果你不知道自己对什么有热情, 跟着自己兴趣走是一种好的方法. 对大多数年轻人来说, 一个好的座右铭是 "掌握一些东西, 任何东西", 通过对一件事的掌握，你可以朝着能给你带来更多快乐的掌握的延伸方向发展，并最终发现你的幸福在哪里。
